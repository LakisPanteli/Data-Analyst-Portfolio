# <p>Video Game Sales Analysis<p/>
</p>This project analyses sales of Xbox One and Playstation 4 games. I have analysed key metrics, such as top games, top genres, top publishers and revenue by region. This provides insights to market trends over time, best-selling games, genres and publishers and differences between platforms. I have used SQL-driven data analysis alongside with Power BI visualizations, providing key insights to the business to make informed decisions.<p/>
